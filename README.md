[Description] Helpful utilities for working with CoinMarketCap data

# Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt<br>

# Description
Example for pulling historical data without using the formal CoinMarketCap API, requiring auth, etc.<br>
Most of this isn't tested at all and it's very likely that if you spam it, or request a TON of data, or something else stupid you will get your IP rate-limited / banned.<br>
Best of luck soldiers.
